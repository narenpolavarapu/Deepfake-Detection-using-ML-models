# Deepfake-Detection-using-ML-models

A deepfake is a computer-generated image or video
that appears to be real but it’s a fake that was produced to make
someone appear to be saying or doing something they weren’t.
It creates misleading or deceptive information by manipulating
and superimposing faces onto pre-existing footage using artificial
intelligence. This project presents a novel approach to deepfake detection using a combination of EfficientNet and Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs). Our approach improves detection efficiency
by utilizing the hierarchical features that EfficientNet acquired
and using RNNs specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
networks to capture temporal dependencies. By applying the
above approach to the Celeb-DF dataset we have achieved an
accuracy of 99.98%.
